Welcome to the ultimate Python network programming challenge! 🎉
Mission Briefing

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a series of Python scripts that will make you a master of the network universe. 💻
Scripts
0. Status Check

Write a Python script that fetches the status of https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status using urllib. Yes, it's that simple! 😊
1. Header Hunter

Create a script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the X-Request-Id variable found in the response header. You'll need urllib and sys for this one. 🔍
2. Email Blaster

Write a script that takes a URL and an email, sends a POST request with the email as a parameter, and displays the response body (decoded in utf-8). You'll need urllib and sys again! 📧
3. Error Catcher

Create a script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the response body (decoded in utf-8). But here's the twist: you need to catch urllib.error.HTTPError exceptions and print the HTTP status code! 🚨
4. Status Check (Again!)

Write a script that fetches the status of https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status using requests. Yep, same mission, different package! 😊
5. Header Hunter (Again!)

Create a script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the X-Request-Id variable found in the response header. This time, use requests and sys. 🔍
6. Email Blaster (Again!)

Write a script that takes a URL and an email, sends a POST request with the email as a parameter, and displays the response body. You'll need requests and sys again! 📧
7. Error Catcher (Again!)

Create a script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the response body. If the HTTP status code is 400 or higher, print the error code! 🚨
8. JSON API Explorer

Write a script that takes a letter, sends a POST request to http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user with the letter as a parameter, and displays the id and name if the response is valid JSON. Otherwise, display an error message! 📊
10. GitHub ID Finder

Create a script that takes your GitHub credentials (username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id. You'll need requests and sys for this one! 🤖
100. GitHub Commit Explorer

Write a script that takes a repository name and owner name, and displays the commits. You'll need requests and sys again! 📈
Good Luck, Ninja!

May the code be with you! 💫
